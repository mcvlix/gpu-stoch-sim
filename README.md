## CUDA-accelerated stochastic differential equation (SDE) solvers for PyTorch

A modular framework for simulating and benchmarking multiple runs of Itô SDEs on both CPU and GPU.  
Currently, it implements Euler–Maruyama integration in pure PyTorch and as a fused CUDA kernel for high-performance parallel stochastic simulation.

A lightweight, conceptual notebook is viewable in `euler-maruyama_demo.ipynb`. I am still developing and learning myself!
